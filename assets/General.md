# **General**

## Physics: 

The red/blue/green and yellow robots will always move vertically 
or horizontally until they bump into an obstacle (A wall or another robot).
Below you can see a picture that shows how the blue robot can find its way into the blue saturn within four moves.

## Target:

To move a robot in the least number of moves into the given target.
The color of the robot **must match** the color of the target.
**Other robots can also be moved and be used as obstacles**.
All moves of all robots must be taken into account when determining the minumum number of moves

## Game mechanics:

1) Figure out the maximum number of moves required to reach the target.'
2) Submit a bid with your minimum number of moves'
3) When the first player submits a bid, the countdown will start'
4) After countdown the lowest bidder must defend the bid'
5) If the lowest bidder fails, the second lowest bidder takes over, etc..., until a winner is determined'
6) New round with new target'
